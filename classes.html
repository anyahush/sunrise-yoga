                        explore more advanced movements. Classes that don't specify level are general classes and are
                        suitable for all levels. If you are unsure about what level you are at, or want to discuss

                        <h2>Ashtanga</h2>
                        <p>

                            Developed by the late Pattabhi Jois, Ashtanga is a vigorous style of yoga that incorporates
                            set sequences or series of postures where the breath is linked with movement. There are six
                            levels of sequences or series in Ashtanga yoga.

                            The energetic nature of all of the series leads to a cleansing of the body through heat,
                            which enhances circulation, improves joint pain, carries impurities away from
                            the body, and builds strength.

                            The Ashtanga system emphasizes the Eight Limbs of Yoga as outlined in the Yoga Sutras, which
                            Malaspina says serves as practices for living a meaningful life. This system inspires
                            followers to adopt a daily practice of yoga.

                        <h2>Hatha</h2>
                        <p>The Sanskrit term "hatha" is an umbrella term for all physical postures of yoga. In the West,
                            hatha yoga simply refers to all the other styles of yoga (ashtanga, Iyengar, etc.) that are
                            grounded in a physical practice. However, there are other branches of yoga such as kriya,
                            raja, and karma yoga that are separate from the physical-based yoga practice. Hatha yoga can
                            help reduce aniexty and improve mental health, improve and support balance and improve
                            overall fitness. Our hatha
                            class is a combination of centering excerises, mediatation and finding alignment
                            through breath, balance and movement.

                        <h2>Restorative</h2>
                        <p>Restorative yoga focuses on winding down after a long day and relaxing your mind. At its
                            core, this style focuses on body relaxation. Restorative yoga also helps to cleanse and free
                            your mind. Restorative yoga can help improve quality of sleep, manage aniexty and mental
                            health and alleviate stress. It is great to let go of a stressful day or relaxing and
                            preparing for a busy day ahead, and ensuring you make time for yourself. Our restorative
                            yoga class, we focus of set postures, breathwork and stillness. If props are required, we
                            have some at the studio.
