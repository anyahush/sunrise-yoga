# Sunrise Yoga

Sunrise Yoga is a mobile-first website that aims to positively promote yoga, its benefits and encourage visitors to uptake classes at the studio. This website has been designed to ensure that visitors feel a sense of peace, balance and growth when exploring the site. Visitors can find information on the benefits of yoga, yoga styles available, studio times, location and contact information. The primary goal of the site is to promote the studio and increase attendance at classes.
This website has been created for my Milestone 1 User Centric Frontend Development Project.

## Surface Plane

The design elements of this site have been selected to convey feelings of serenity and ease.

### Colour Scheme 

In the initial planning stages of the project, I conducted research into colours most associated with peace, balance, health and nature, as these concepts have associations with yoga. I wanted this to be a consistent message for the user. 

The colours chosen are:
* #3e837b- teal colour
* #515d5f- dark slate grey
* rgba(255, 201, 173, 0.5) peach
* #ee9061 apricot
