# Sunrise Yoga

Sunrise Yoga is a mobile-first website that aims to positively promote yoga, its benefits and encourage visitors to uptake classes at the studio. This website has been designed to ensure that visitors feel a sense of peace, balance and growth when exploring the site. Visitors can find information on the benefits of yoga, yoga styles available, studio times, location and contact information. The primary goal of the site is to promote the studio and increase attendance at classes.
This website has been created for my Milestone 1 User Centric Frontend Development Project.

## Surface Plane

The design elements of this site have been selected to convey feelings of serenity and ease.

### Colour Scheme 

In the initial planning stages of the project, I conducted research into colours most associated with peace, balance, health and nature, as these concepts have associations with yoga. I wanted this to be a consistent message for the user. 

[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was used at first to establish a combination of colours that compliment each other. 

![Coolors Colour Palette](../readme-images/ms1-colours.png)

After further research and exploration, the final colours chosen are as below. 

* #3e837b- Celadon Green
* #515d5f- Deep Space Sparkle
* rgba(255, 201, 173, 0.5)- Apricot
* #ee9061- Atomic Tangerine

## Deployment

The following steps were followed to deploy the project to a live website in GitHub, using Github Pages:

- Ensure changes have been added and commited in Gitpod and pushed to GitHub.
- Login to GitHub.
- Locate the relevant repository on GitHub. This is the repository for [Sunrise Yoga](https://github.com/anyahush/sunrise-yoga).
- At the top of the repository, locate the 'Settings' link and click on this.
- On the left of the page, under Options, scroll down until you get to Pages and click on Pages.
- Under Source, in the first box called "None", click the dropdown and select "master".
- Then select Save.
- The page will refresh and you will see a link above the Save button. This is the link to the live site. Note that it may take a few minutes for the site to be deployed.
- There are no differences between the deployed version and the development version of this project.

### Forking the GitHub Repository
The repository can be forked on GitHub, this creates a copy of the repository that can be viewed or amended without affecting the original repository. This can be done using the following steps:

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- At the top right of the repository (under your avatar) locate the Fork button and click this button.
- There should now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account, which you can amend.

### Cloning the GitHub Repository
A clone of the repository can be made, which will create a local copy on your own computer. Changes can be made to this local copy and it will not affect the original repository. Follow these steps to clone the Sunrise Yoga repository.

- Login to GitHub and locate the repository as before.
- Click the button called "Code".
- Under HTTPS copy the link provided, in this case (https://github.com/anyahush/sunrise-yoga.git).
- Go to Gitpod or whichever IDE you are using and open the Terminal.
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type 'git clone' followed by the url you copied in step 3.
- Press "Enter" to create the local clone.
